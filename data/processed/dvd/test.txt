I watched this movie in health class during a unit on ageing.  The movies was very touching, and turned the whole class to tears.  But, it was a great movie that was very touching, and I would suggest watching it	1
I was very inspired by the interview with Michale Flately. My family enjoyed the shows on the DVD as well. It was definately worth buying	1
I loved the series of the supermario bros supershow. I use to watch this all the time when I was in the 1st grade. Im still a big mario fan and I hope they will make an entire DVD collection. If they did I will buy the whole thing. I didnt know they were going to make this on DVD SWEET	1
If you have ever come across a Home Movies episode, maybe at about 3 am on Comedy Central, hopefully you immediately recognized the transcendent hilarity and quickly began devoting the rest of your life to enjoying more episodes.  If that did not happen, buy the Season 3 dvd's because Brendan Small is just immensely funny and enjoyable.  The Renaissance Fair episode is unbelievable	1
There were loads of Swords & Sorcery films coming out in the 80's, most of them low budget garbage.  But this was actually one of the better films.  It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable.  Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant.  Pretty standard stuff.  But it's exectuted well.  The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story "The Hour of the Dragon" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer.  In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun.  In this movie, the name is Xusia.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.  But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame).  He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life.  Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time.	1
The technical quality of the DVD is excellent.  My interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend's wall of Charlie Chaplin and an actor.  The actor, Hugh Sasson, was the Uncle of my friend's mother.  He appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked.  The photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet.  We set the photo on the TV and stepped through this scene on the DVD one frame at a time.  It gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time.	1
First, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny.  In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty.  Watch this movie	1
"Mighty Quinn" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There's a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn's own discomfort from having "made good" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He's also caught between the islanders' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn't quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner	1
... then this would be a really serious detective. As it's executed now, it's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones. Cool	1
my brother bought a used copy at wal mart and I decided to borrow it despite him saying it was stupid. It isn't. It's actually real funny and entertaining.	1
This animation is as hilarious as when it was first aired, maybe even more so as the careers of some of those who sat on the good doctor's couch have blossomed eg David Cross, who you may remember from such shows as Arrested Development. Even Ray Romano is funny. The animation is great, especially the New York City scenes. Ben Katz is a scene stealer. I need to see 'Feng Shui' and 'Sticky Notes' on DVD please.	1
If you are at all interested in synthesizers, their impact on the music world, and how the Moog synthesizer changed history, this is a 'must have'.	1
I first saw "Dragonslayer" when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981.  It was the first VHS movie I ever purchased.  It's very well made, an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about. It still holds up. Caitlin Clarke's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job.  I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter.  I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004.  "Dragonslayer" has action, humor, humanity, political irony.  And if none of those matter to you: it's just plain fun	1
Good movie with a unique storyline.  Special effects were very	1
Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance.   DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch.  Very good stuff there.  The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie.  This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on.  Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck	1
I bought a balance ball kit from another location, but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit.  I like the workout a lot and I think it will be a good strengthening and toning tool.  I like that there is a separate relaxation workout for stress relief and I like that the workout cycles through the different body parts	1
The uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on TV. Though there are still some diferences between the Japanese version and what is in the uncut version. I wouldn't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core Naruto fan. The bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs	1
The great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.	1
What do you know about being underground? Get this if you really suck at djing	1
"I Wake Up Screaming" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of "noir" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called "mystery lighting"- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate.	1
First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same souffl -light rom-com territory as Ol Parker's half-hearted "Imagine Me and You" and Ian Iqbal Rashid's overly cute "A Touch of Pink". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.	1
Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.	1
A lot of people like me who watches superhero movies want to watch a whole bunch of action with soo much CGI you cant even tell what's real or not. Anyways, I expected this movie to have the too much action I can handle. Guess I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but I just hope Spidey 3 will have tons of action!!!!!!!! And Tons of CGI EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 3 NEW VILLAINS!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!! SANDMAN, HOBGOBLIN, and VENOM!!!!!!!!! Anwyays, just don't make the movie about Peter Parker, but Spider-Man, THANK YOU Stan Lee for creating Spider-man	1
Threshold starring Carla Gugino (Special guest Catherine Bell episode #11 Outbreak):	1
CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's "SURFACE" and ABC's "INVASION", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.	1
Don't be fooled by stupid commercials that make this movie look inappropriate or like soap operas.  This movie is awsome and not at all about the guys chasing the girls, inappropriate behavior, or anything.  It's definitely worth seeing and watching again.  Great movie	1
An excellent total body toning workout by two motivating (and non-annoying) instructors. This is a perfect workout to add to any workout regime. Highly recommend this	1
I've been encouraged by Pat Metheny's music since 1980... that's a long time to follow one guy's music track, but through it all he has always grown and done more than you would expect. His trio record set the standard in the early days, with Bright Size Life (w. Jaco and Bob Moses), and his PMG work has been unusual and different and refreshing. One reviewer mentions "cheesy tunes" - in what sense? In the sense that they don't conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we've come to expect (swing+sax+trumpet+upright bass + x y and z=jazz)? Great jazz musicians are innovators, and what PMG has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it's own genre of music unto itself - completely unique. Are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this? No way. Not even one. I know cheesy music when I hear it, and there are plenty of so-called mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects. Most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like Miles or kind of like Coltrane or Brecker or whatever. The great ones are the ones others are compared TO, and Pat Metheny falls in that category.	1
I FIRST WATCHED THIS INCREDIBLE GROUP OF MUSICIANS I BELIEVE ON AUSTIN CITY LIMITS AND WAS TOTALLY TAKEN IN BY THE MAGIC THESE GUYS PERFORM ALONG WITH VERY, VERY GOOD CAMERA WORK WHICH COMPLIMENTED THEIR EVERY MOVE. PAT'S FASCIALS ARE CAPTURED INTENSLY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE MUSICIANS PERFECTIONISM..	1
I've been doing Pilates for several months along w/ my daily Yoga practice and it's been an incredible and effective addition to my program!	1
I really ejoyed this film.I can't wait to watch it again.This Christmas flick has a great angle,and a wonderfull ending.I always liked the traditional holiday movies,"White Christmas,Holiday Inn," now "Surviving Christmas" is included	1
I loved watching this when I was younger and my daughter loves it now. I actually bought this because she wanted it for her 10th birthday	1
This is a fantastic Keith Urban video.  My favorites would undoubtedly be "Somebody Like You," and "Raining On Sunday." I wondered why Keith wasn't barefooted in the "Where the Blacktop Ends" video :) even so it's a great DVD worth adding to your collection! My only disappointment was that there wasn't a video of "You'll Think of Me.	1
Hey Pizanos! It's the Super Mario Bros Super show! Sound familiar to you? If it does, great! That just means that your ready for season two of The Super Mario Bros Super show. Mario, Luigi, and Toad are back to save Princess Toadstool and themselves out of the evil King Koopa's hands. There are all of the remaining episodes on this disc except for four. I understand that Shout faught Dic for the remaining four with no success. Go figure. Oh well. You atleast get to see the other episodes on all of these discs with no audio problems as mentioned for season one. There are also special features on all four DVD's to play around with. Want to look at the outline for how the idea for the set came about? Take a basement tour! See how the creators met Lou Albano, plus more! Everybody get ready to do the Mario and go back to your child hood and watch the good guys win and triaumph over the evil forces of King Bowser Koopa.	1
Definitely a great movie, Rules of Engagement, brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously; that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the Marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in Yemen, and the inner struggle of the investigator/defence lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since Vietnam....	1
Unlike Marshall Fine,who wrote the Amazon review, I don't find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all!  Sadly, politically I believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda, and I am not just talking about recently.  I am sure there are flaws in the movie, but I wasn't watching the movie for flaws.  Truthfully, military movies are not my favorite genre.  Having said that, I found myself up very late one night and "happened upon" this fine movie. I was mesmerized.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were brilliant, but it was the short segment with the former officer in the North Vietnamese Army that riveted my attention more than any other scene.  Just brilliant!   I can't say more or I will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it.  Needless to say, I give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think, one I will talk about in years to come.  That's a barometer for my star-meter!	1
I'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.	1
OK folks, this is by far one of the best DVDs I've bought in quite awhile. You get so much for so little. First you get the original black and white movie. Reefer Madness is like the Three Stooges, black and white just adds to its charm. But to see it in color is quite a hoot. The smoke is purple and pink, the suits and dresses are LOUD, and the color scheme for Mae's apartment is just mind boggling. What more could you ask for? Well you get more anyway.	1
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence.	1
Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a "killer" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features.	1
Up until now, "Basic Instinct" has always been that little movie in pop culture in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant. After watching this movie, that is exactly what I'll remember it for. This movie is pop culture staple, it's stupid and impossible to predict. As soon as you think you've got it, you don't, only to discover you do; as we we see with the ending. The movie what critics refer to as "a bad movie".	1
I have a little brother who is 7, and severely disabled,(He's on a 9 month old level) Not much catches his eye, but one day when he was throwing a tantrum, I put it on nick jr,and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the  singing   Backyardigans. He couldn't stop looking at the colorful animation.This show is a lifesaver! It kept him entertained for the whole 30min. I'd heard about the show from a friend,who has a 1 yr old who loves the show, and she told me to try it out. I took her advice and my brother loved it! And as soon as I saw it on VHS, I bought it.He loves "the snow fort", but his favorite is "the Yeti", He laughs the whole time the penguin sings "The Yeti Stomp". I also  bought him "It great to be a ghost" DVD  for christmas.I recommend this for any little children, it works like a charm.[^_^	1
I ordered this after seeing Peggy on PBS doing yoga with a 97 year old woman.  I've got some lung problems and was looking for something low impact that I could do to help build my capacity.  The DVD is great and easy to follow.  Peggy breaks the session down into three parts of twenty minutes, so you can do an hour or less as your schedule indicates.  Best of all, you work from a chair, so this is truly adaptable to any age and fitness level	1
This dvd shows Shania's potential as a serious musician. With Alison Krauss and Union Station as her back up here, she is simply riveting. Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like "Up!" instead of making enduring popular country classics like "The Woman In Me" and "Come On Over". Maybe she's living too well nowadays to make soulful music. Get this dvd if you want to hear Shania doing something good.	1
You can't really call yourself a Pauly Shore fan unless you love Son-in-Law. And it's hard not to love this movie. Granted, it is prone to a bit of cheesiness, but this is what we both love and respect about Pauly Shore. Becca is a fresh from the farm in South Dakota, now in California at college and on her own for the first time. She misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she doesn't fit in. But Crawl (Pauly Shore, in perfect Pauly form) her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be. When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly, Becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn't want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to Becca. Now absolute silliness takes over and it's just so much fun from here on out. If you need something fun and funny to watch, give Son-in-Law a try. One of my all-time favorites in my collection of silly comedies. You'll love it	1
Naysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and self-indulgent, but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly "real" and show us the ugly truths about celebrity.  Asia's film would make a good double bill with DOGVILLE to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism. Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist. But I bet if a man made this film, these selfsame critics would line up to praise it. Obviously many self-proclaimed feminists (of both sexes) are still secretly terrified, turned-off and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her "real" self. They are all the more angry because their knee-jerk reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly "liberated" female voice as they might like to think. I say Asia has created something truly new with Scarlet Diva. It's ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of "chick flick.	1
my daughters ages 8 and 6 like the movie but my son who is 15 months really loves being able to watch all his Sesame Street friends in a movie	1
Ok... this series isn't exactly like the Final Fantasy games, but the elements are there. For instance, you have chocobo's, you have cactuar's, you have the summoning of Guardian Forces (which by the way look really cool), you have character's which have too much power for their own good, and a journey. This journey is that of Ai and Yu's search for their parents, where they are accompanied by Lisa Pacifist, a woman who possesses the cool power of Kigen Arts. During their journey, they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland (I wont say anymore, I dont want to spoil too much of the plot).	1
I rented Terror Train (1980) with a friend of mine about ten years ago and I remember after we watched it we were both like "Is that it?"  Not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time, but I decided to give it another chance, and you know what?  I liked it...I really did...I'll grant you it's not an outstanding feature, but the effort is there, resulting in an overall solid film.  Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Turner & Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies), the movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda), who, a couple years earlier, had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called Halloween (1978).  Also appearing is Ben Johnson (Hang 'Em High, Red Dawn), Hart Bochner (Breaking Away, Supergirl, Die Hard), Derek McKinnon (Breaking All the Rules), Sandee Currie (Terminal Choice), Timothy Webber (The Hotel New Hampshire), and David Copperfield, who was at one time engaged to supermodel Claudia Schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work, earning himself a place in the `What the f?' hall of fame.	1
Up until last years Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors was considered	1
This is such a fun movie to watch. It is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it. Encino Man and Pauly Shore is one of the reasons why the early 90s ruled. There are so many cool scenes in this like when Stoney takes Link to 7-11 and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on. And when they go to the Mountian and ride the Viper in reverse. And the drivers ed  scene when Link thinks it is Rad Mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the Mexicans. "You see that girl muchacho. Dont look at her!" The prom scene was cool to, it had Infectious Grooves in it. They are a real band but that song was made for the movie. The singer and bass player are in Suicidal Tendencies and the bass player plays for Metallica now. But anyways... Yeah , this movie is totally radical. Daves room is really cool to. I wish my room was that rad. The school looks cool too. I wish my high school was like that. I notice that whenever i watch something like this that was filmed in the early 90s everything seemed real bright and cheerful. Am i crazy or has anyone else noticed this? Pauly Shores punch lines and phrases never get old. They age like a fine wine... Bud-dy.	1
I've also reviewed the first two volumes but I honestly believe that Volume Three is the best.  I plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but, if I had to pick a single best volume, it would be this one.	1
Quality was as good or better as I could expect from VHS tapes from the 70's, but loved the DVDs...  I did notice minor 10 second syncing problems with Disk 1.	1
The product produced a clear picture good sound it was like being back in 1975 and experiencing that World Series for the first time. I enjoyed every minute of the games and interviews	1
If you are a Dale Jr fan,this dvd is for you!! I'm a hardcore fan and I loved this.It shows the other side of Dale off the track,him with his buddies and just hangin out.He lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done that.In the hidden footage you even get to see his cat Bud which adorable!!!He shows off his new home and the shop	1
I knew that I wanted this movie, but I had forgotten much of the plot.  It is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent; that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant "music"; and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing :-)  Suffice to say that both my wife and I found it very enjoyable!	1
"Stagecoach" is significant, along with "Destry Rides Again", for redefining the Western for "adult" audiences.  Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences.  For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes.  "Stagecoach" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences.  Wayne's entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends.  There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar.  The film's status as being historically significant is not debatable.  As first class entertainment it is timeless	1
What do you get when you have rock the devil's son and Adam Sandler pLaying the devil's son?You get Little Nicky.This is the strangest movie Adam Sandler has possibly ever played in.	1
This is a fun "art house" movie. Fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director. Just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house: not a message movie like many such films but instead in-your-face film making - and three cheers for that. Campbell Scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to get laid. The action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping. This script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by Scott's character. Scott's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film. One review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie, venting naturally (and within limits) when he was thrown over by his boss/lover. Like him or hate him, the player is a pro from beginning to end. The viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women. In the final analysis what matters is how well Campbell Scott's character plays the game and he is a rodger dodger in an age of Politically Correct repression. How refreshing! Five stars out of five	1
These were the first two with Captain Kirk.  I have to admitt that I own all 40 volumes.  Yet I still may get the box sets.  Each episode runs for 50 minutes.  Longer than a 45 minute episode of The Next Generation, but shorter than the unaired 63 minute pilot; The Cage	1
Read between the lines, Stephane is nuts about her, and totally paralyzed.  This reminds me of Remains of the Day. Everything is inside, screaming to get out.  But there we are, tension city, with  nothing to do but yell at the screen, "Do something!!! Kiss her!! .."  THe emotional tension is as tight as the violin strings in the background!   Vive la repressione!	1
That special team is gone, those players have mostly moved on, but "we'll always have 2004".  Great way to relive the fun, the hope and the victories.  For every diehard fan.	1
THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the epitome of how sublime the Film Noir genre can be.  The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband.  Based on the novel by James M. Cain and boasting the stylish performances of Lana Turner and John Garfield, this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic.  Over half a century later, we are still singing it's praises.	1
You can't wipe murder off our hands; well perhaps you can, especially if you're like the two main protagonists in The Postman Always Rings Twice, an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy, murky paranoia. Based on the novel by James M. Cain, the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession.	1
I was reluctant to watch "Almost Famous" because I figured it would be chock full of hype...but for some reason I decided to finally sit down and watch this story...and I'm glad I did.  I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.	1
BEST MEN surprised me very much; I wasn't expecting such a delightful, if a little bit depressing, movie.  Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot.	1
What happens when you title a movie "Mind the Gap" and lead the credits with Alan King? Few people under seventy become interested. But this is a great movie about life, relationships, and "the gap".	1
Just as I remember it when it first came out in the eightys.  Good movie but got little recognition, my wife who is 10 years younger than I had never heard of it, but was impressed	1
No, he doesn't.	1
This was much, much better than I expected it to be.  A real tear jerker.  If I was to let myself cry, this movie would've been it, not "The Joy Luck Club".  Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination.  He was simply great.  I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me.  Of course, he was also terrific in "The Godfather Part 3".  Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films.  But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8.  Also, the look of the film, set in San Francisco, is good, especially the interiors of their house.  Garcia really seems to care about Ryan.  This movie is about love, and how it doesn't always carry the day with alcoholics.  I also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things, they've been married and had a kid (you don't learn til much later that he is not the older kid's dad), and we see her drink a lot.  They don't start with how they fell in love, or even attempt to explain why she's an alcoholic.  Smart	1
Robert Preston is the best Professor Hill. This is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collectio	1
I'm not going to try to get all the characters names right in Yi Yi.  And there are a lot of characters, an extended family and various lovers and children.  Taiwan is a modern, impressive city, a place rarely seen on American television or film. I might be looking at Manhattan rather than Taipei.  The computer engineer's family, the wife with spiritual emptiness, the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity, the grandmother on life support, and the eight-year old son teased to exhaustion by little girls, they live in a high-rise condominium over a raised superhighway.  Then there's the ner-do-well brother-in-law, so superstitious that he marries his pregnant wife only on a Chinese lucky day. His old girlfriend shows up at the wedding to raise hell.  She returns at the babies Chinese confirmation for more of the same.  A fight breaks out, kicking little men and screechy women.	1
`Ben-Hur' released in '59 is an inspirational tale of betrayal and revenge, love and endurance, forgiveness and redemption played out amidst the backdrop of the last years of Jesus Christ's earthly ministry.	1
When I am watching a 1984 sci-fi movie, I am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns.  Some may call it predictible, but myself I feel that the story flowed and made sense.  Too many times have I seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere.  Tom Sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop.  Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well. I for one enjoyed this movie alot, and unlike Blade Runner didn't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line. If you are looking for a believeable near future story, pick this up	1
HOUSE OF STRANGERS is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes. Edward G.Robinson is Gino Moretti, a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral. In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations. It is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons, insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there. It is only Max (Richard Conte), who can see,if only belatedly, the vision of his father. And even Max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers. Max cannot do this alone; he requires the understanding first of Maria (Debra Paget) then later Helen (Susan Hayward), both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within. Gino Moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons,"Who do you think I built this bank for?" generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father. The difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may, in similar real-life situations, have emerged. What goes around truly comes around, and HOUSE OF STRANGERS continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche	1
Before anything else, I agree with those who say that Keaton's shorts are all good; but I strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features. What usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say: OK, make me laugh. Keaton's features are funny -but they are also, and more important, beautifully shot, superbly acted and perfectly structured -which is something only the best actors/directors can put all together. There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20's. Keaton's characters move in the real world, with real things, and that's part of what makes them lasting and unique.	1
I love agressive ski videos that just kick [...], and STORM just rips. No stupid bikini skiing or inner tube follies (that I can remember) just great skiing superbly shot with an awesome soundtrack. My neighbors can hear me when I play this. They think I have a screw loose.	1
As a moderate skiier, and a filmmaker myself, this hits it home for me.  Warren Miller films are always shown locally, and there's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year.	1
This recommendation is for the uncut version of Leon - The Professional.  A well crafted, tightly edited, excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll.  An action film that can be appreciated by those who generally don't care for the genre, the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it.  If you're looking for something worthwhile to watch, check this one out	1
Luc Besson's "The Professional"  raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman.	1
Love Shelly Long movies, and Bette Midler too.  This is very enjoyable and funny.  Was thrilled to have found a copy on Amazon.	1
I love this movie. I can't go an entire day without watching it. One time i was in the audience of leno. Whenever the camera panned over us, i waved a copy of this pleasure in front of it while yelling about how funny this riot is. Ahh, funny i remember the part where that one guy has to itch his balls. Just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation!!! Rent this movie or you will not see it. Buy it or forever hold your peace	1
Royal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire's dance on the ceiling ("You're All the World to Me") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian's Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film's merits--it speaks for itself.	1
We all make mistakes in relationships, things we wish we could relive, do over.  This movie investigates the dynamics of one love relationship.  We go through two sceneros.  The first gives one the chance to live over a stituation, correcting all the mistakes he thinks he has made.	1
I have watched this movie four times now, and every time at the end of the movie I am crying like a baby..... It's so sad!!! But still so good	1
sexy, funny, and addictive.  I can't wait to buy season 3	1
I think this is the best of the Monty Python movies, although I love them all.  This edition has lots of extra features, like a documentary on the Monty Python guys made during the filming of this movie - I learned lots of things I didn't know about them.  Overall I couldn't be happier	1
There's only one word to describe this movie: suhweeeeeeeet! Despite the dozens of imitators, Bloodsport was the first and best of its kind. From the classic training sequence where young Frank Dux masters the martial arts (and receives the katana he coveted as a boy), to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques, to the repeated chanting of "Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te!" on the pounding soundtrack, there's hardly a moment that won't have you pumped and calling for more. The only parts that don't quite work are the chase scenes and a young Forest Whittaker, who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in. But they don't detract from the main attraction: bone-crushing, blood-spattering beatdowns, and plenty of 'em. This is a quintessential guys' movie, and if you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to check it out	1
this 1988 gore film (i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the "Substitute" series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical "innocent" woman caught up in everything that's going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but "Dead Heat" IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor	1
I thought this DVD set was halarious!  I was hoping it wouldn't be the case where I saw it before, and remembered it to be funnier than it really was.  But that was not the case.  It truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show I've ever seen!	1
I'm a big fan of Roseanne, so It was no surprise to me that the Halloween edition wouldn't be great.	1
This show was excellent in every aspect. I was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my TV until the closing credits. It was so fun to see the entire Osmond Clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time. I especially enjoyed seeing Debbie, Donny's wife sing a duet with Donny. And the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well. There was even a guest appearance by the Osmond grandparents. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow. I'd never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show. One of the best Christmas specials I've seen in a long time. It made me wish that I was part of their family. After watching this I'm more convinced than ever that I am the fat Osmond who Mother Osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the Pacific Northwest	1
My daughter is 17 months old, and next to Rock and Roll, this is probably her least favorite of the Sesame Street movies (and we have a lot of them).  If your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on Sesame Street (Elmo, Ernie, Cookie, Grover, etc.), they might not be as interested in this one (although Elmo is the cohost of the awards show with Herry).  It is nice to see the monsters that don't get a lot of play, though.  Herry Monster is in about half of the songs.  It is worth it if you don't have any videos with Monster in the Mirror (also on Rock and Roll), Fuzzy and Blue (on Sesame Street 25th Anniversary), or C is for Cookie (on several of the DVDs).	1
One of the best films I have seen: captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously. Humanises conflict. Has the ability to make you laugh and cry. Draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the Middle East. I would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing. Having said that, it did plunge me into depression so perhaps I should urge caution	1
I really enjoy this workout, with the DVD I can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the VHS.	1
Standard Elmo - Nothing special, but still a good video	1
This movie was obviously weak in many ways, one of them being the acto	1
"The master" at acting like a conceited prat! A "master" at complicating a simple situation with self-righteous, snotty, santimonious drivel while making fun of people who he deems are intellectually inferior to his royal self by twisting their ideas and words around to suit his assault on them. He seems somewhat taken with Alan Price who was there to 'brown-tongue' .. or maybe Alan had nothing else better to do, because he had just been fired from The Animals. Price DID get drunk and throw a glass out onto the street much to the annoyance of Zimmerman... he also opened a bottle of beer on a piano keyboard taking a chip out of the instrument showing total lack of respect for other people's property. I guess obnoxious prats stick together, huh?	1
another Jean-claude van damme classic,tw0 jean-claudes? which is good? whos the wimp? Just watch the movi	1
I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan. However "The Searchers" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still "The Searchers" is a classic and deserves to be better known.	1
Even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive, this is by far the best adaptation of the famous British Navy story. Gable and Laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed.  I'm not a huge Gable fan.  This and Gone W/ the Wind are abt all I like him in	1
If you loved this movie, try 50 First Dates.  The surprising chemisty from Drew and Adam continues in that movie.  I love the humor and the 80s clothes!! :-	1
A solid series until the end. Even though this season the deaths are not important it centers more on the families.  It was sad to see the serise end but it is probably the series finale ever.	1
What's not to like about Richard Farnsworth? He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable "old man." Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor.	1
If there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it!  Mrs. O'Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn't trust Edwina, the new beauty that's come to town.  The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end.  Or does she?  If I said any more, I'd be spoiling the story.  Just watch this movie, and enjoy.  Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for	1
He highlights the concepts very well, for example the chapter on ball striking, i never knew this concept in 2 years of playing golf.	1
This movie was not only subject to some good acting by some great actors, it was also a well written tale of of young woman who grew up too soon. I feel like I know Miss Holiday a whole lot better now	1
Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast:	1
I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.  This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story.  Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise?  Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking.  A wonderful, wonderful film	1
Since I was a child I have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil. It was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room, at slumber parties and later when I started working as a clerk in a grocery store. It was a never ending argument- Who would win in the battle of Freddy and Jason? In my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters, but I don't think that it ever existed and if it did I have never laid my eyes on such a relic, but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to DVD. It was everything I hoped for. There was blood, brief nudity and really bad jokes. That is the unholy trinity of horror. The plot wasn't horrible, it was actually pretty good for a fright flick.	1
Jason X (as in Friday the 13th Part 10) sheds light on a familiar, though not too friendly, face: that of Jason.  A "miracle of science," Jason, is to be transported from a maximum-security facility to a research lab.  The transfer goes awry and he's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended.	1
after the worst "friday" movie of all time(and thats saying a lot) the series bounces back (nine years later) with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor ordered.having been caught and chained by the goverment, jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who "buck rogers" like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at.	1
This is a fantastic history of the Blues!  Unlike any of the other recent documentaries, the stories are related in this show entirely by the artists.  There is no narrator and the feel of the show is very personal!  Add to that some great music and you have a winner	1
John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono were guests on the Dick Cavett show three times in 1971.  Their first apearance was taped on Saturday, September 11, 1971 and was John's first interview after the Beatles had disbanded.  The subsequent interviews were taped on Friday, September 24, 1971 and Thursday, May 11, 1972.	1
Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this	1
Certainly the best kung-fu movie I've ever seen, Kung Fu Hustle is loaded with effects and humor, and stunning fight sequences to boot.  Try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn, even the great Bruce Lee is tired and played-out in comparison to Kung Fu Hustle.  The movie continues to top itself throughout, with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds, seeing Buddha, lightly stepping off a bird, and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a fifty-foot hole in a building!  This aint just wire-fu, it's wired-fu with hilarious weirdness.	1
I know what you're thinking. If you're anything at all like me, when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly, I thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen. But I'll admit readily when I'm wrong, and here I absolutely was. I'm not saying Little Nicky is the world's greatest film, or even comedy, but if you like Adam Sandler and silly comedies in general, this is a movie that won't disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week (or even day) at work.	1
It is the best movie I have ever seen. It was so funny. Adam Sandler is the best actor in the world which makes it even better. I saw it at my friend's house. I would watch it again but I don't have it. Little kids under 6 should not see this movie. You will defiantly like this movie. That is why you should buy this movie.	1
I bought this season of Survivor (I never saw this season) but it was very, very good. I'm glad that Jon lost and Sandra won! I was shocked when they let outcasts back into the game. I'm glad that Lill came back. But I was mad that Burton came back! 4 stars	1
"Annie Hall" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.	1
Not dissin the USA tour, but i loved the Europe Tour DVD better, after i saw this one. This DVD was a nice Eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me. I can relate to his music madness and Anger issues, it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and Detroit love. I passed it along for other college woman to view~LMAO	1
Unfairly overlooked in the early 90's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80's slasher films 'POPCORN(1991)' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind,some decent acting,a ludicrous story,some good dark atmosphere,decent kills,plenty of cheese & a pretty creepy villain. The parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent & Wes Craven & the makers of 'SCREAM' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration	1
What more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it's here). POPE is Vincent Patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles.  The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered:  The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors.  Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom.  Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL.  She's more enjoyable here	1
Man,talk about your untypical,not your average,regular kung fu movie!!Steven Chow blew the audiences away with this super hit.For those who have'nt seen it yet,it's a treat you simply cannot miss.Excellent dvd for anyone to add to their collection of favorites	1
I wouldn't write yet another review of War and Peace if I didn't have something new to say about it, namely, War and Peace and War by Peter Turchin. Near the end of Turchin's book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Arme metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time. Pick up Turchin's deep book, and afterwards read War and Peace, paying particular attention to Turchin's and Tolstoy's ideas. You will never see historical dynamics the same again.	1
This cartoon gives me the entire memories when i use to watch them as a little kid.The DVD may not have the great special features,But if you ever see this sucker available in a store don't think about it just buy it	1
I've been a Christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of Rutherford's handling of the character.   I loved Joan Hickson's portrayal of Miss Marple and never thought anyone else could "be" Miss Marple for me.  Therefore I expected to be disappointed with these new releases.  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED, I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION!  After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role.  She is subtle, confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful.   The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing.   Some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here.   Christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way.   Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times.  I think it's fun to be surprised by my old favorites!  Hooray for Geraldine McEwan!  I hope to see many more Miss Marple stories with her in the title role	1
Released during the "Just Say No" 1980s, this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse.  Lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world, to make a little money. He soon impresses a big wheel  who moves Lenny and his wife to California where they are at first  overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it.  Lenny continues to buy, buy, buy until it all crashes down.  When the money  stops rolling in, he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a  dramatic turn as we watch Lenny lose it all.  James Woods is fabulous as  Lenny.  I've seen this movie many times and now that I'm writing about it,  I think it's time to pop this one into the VCR for another viewing	1
Quite a bit of what I see on the few TV channels I let my kids watch depicts either *borderline* behavior or is so vacuous I cannot stand it.  This series has a plot, good writing and good production values.  It has the added benefit that I can also stand to watch it.  I am hoping the second season maintains the quality of the first	1
I'm the biggest "Wuthering Heights" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they'll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided "Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92.	1
I am a very avid "Star Trek"  fan, and find the DVD's very worthwhile and interesting. ( My Star Trek interests go back to the original series with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy,  James	1
I HAVE TO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE REVIEWER: "MKSONIC50". I READ HIS REVIEW OF "PLAY IT AGAIN SAM" THE SCENE WHERE WOODY ALLEN TRIES TO BE COOL AND COMPOSED WHEN INTRODUCED TO A LADY AND HE, INSTEAD OF SOUNDING ANYTHING LIKE ENGLISH, ONLY GROWLS.	1
Based on the hyper known last farewell of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, will emerge a fabulous, extraordinary and funny script that will allow Allen to lean  on Bogart `s spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend.	1
Joseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story.	1
Excellent. Delivered in a very timely manor. New condition. I could not have been more pleased	1
I Loved the the fact the whole family can watch it	1
The age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960's, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare.  Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.	1
This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.	1
Though cancelled for 2 years, this is the best show on TV in my opinion (even in reruns)	1
We have all heard about `Product Placement' especially in the James Bond films. Did you know it goes all the way back to DR. NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.' That's right, `Red Stripe' Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film.	1
This movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.	1
"Kelly's Heroes" is an odd, yet quite enjoyable war movie. This 1970's comedic, cinematic take on WWII, mixes genres such as the suicide mission/action film, the crime/caper film and the army comedy. In other words, take a lot of "The Dirty Dozen", mix a bit of "Ocean's 11" and add in some "M*A*S*H" plus "Catch-22" and you'll have "Kelly's Heroes". The film features a battered U.S. Army infantry unit, which has been on the front lines since landing at Omaha Beach. All they have on there minds is a little R&R, that includes booze & broads. That is until Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) interrogates (with a bottle of brandy) a captured German intelligence officer, who tells him about a Nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars. Kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small French bank, that is being vigorously guarded by three Nazi 'Tiger' tanks. I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd, but this is one war movie, that is not only suspenseful, but is also a whole lot of fun! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII? Probably not. (I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the "Big One") This 1970 release pretty much through its' hilarious, sharp script  has more of a Vietnam era mentality, which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it's attitudes about war. Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past, these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes, but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**'s intact (and maby make a little profit on the side). The film features a large, talented cast, some of whom, were already stars and others, who later went on to become big names in both television and film. This includes Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, Caroll O'Connor, Gavin MacLeod, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser (Uncle Leo from TV's "Seinfeld"). How can you go wrong with a cast like that? If your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs  mixed in, then I would highly recommend Kelly's Heroes"	1
Its hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will!	1
All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)	1
"GO" takes place in a 24 hour period on christmas eve following 3 of the main characters and events.	1
my gosh mrs. bucket...bouquet has done it again... scared off the neighbors with tea and made us all spit our sides.	1
hyacinth bucket (pronounced bouquet) charges impestuously on, in her indomitable quest for gracious living. hampered as she is, ever so slighly, by the family she occasionally attempts to ignore and often dominate, our heroine carries on in traditional british style. this set is a welcome addition to any british comedy collection. sit down, grab a lager and put your feet up to enjoy....but not on the coffee table! and use a coaster	1
this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out. the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting. Dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from Suge to put out his Death Row classics, but this dvd shines as a replayable classic. You would be so so suprised at what is on this, see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city, you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years...this is quite a different approach.  I was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan, it gives you backstage, it gives you the norml conference...you cant even take it all in if you watched it once!  i say if you like snoop, if you like weed, if you like biatches and hiznoes, you got a winner with the puff puff pass	1
Most of this movie is terrible, but who's complaining?  The epically long "Begin the Beguine" is the climax of the movie & it makes the whole mess worthwhile.  The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection.  The sets, the cinematography, the costumes, the orchestrations & the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make "Begin the Beguine" the most ravishing, glamorous black & white production number ever put on film.  It's Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor.	1
Right after watching this, my wife and I called our (now) 14 yo dancer in to see it.  She in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over.  The look of amazement on ALL of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission.  Like the commercial says;  DVD player; $200, DVD; $15, Watching your daughter work ten times harder on her tapping-priceless	1
Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it	1
All time classic musical/drama/love story.	1
I had often heard about Degrassi: The Next Generation. I went on to the show's website often, even though I didn't get the channel it shows on. I knew as much about the show that everyone else did, and I didn't even see the show. So after a year or two of trying to figure out how to I could see the show, I heard that they were making a DVD, and I was so excited!	1
Ronald Reagan might have gotten the nickname of the "Gipper" from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, but it was veteran character actor Pat O'Brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead. James Cagney had lobbied hard for the role, but when the actor signed a petition supporting the Republican (and anti-Catholic) government in the Spanish Civil War, Notre Dame refused to okay him for the part. This was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in South Bend, and if you do know that the other one was "Rudy" you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one.	1
If no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is "indespensable"!	1
A must-have for all Kate Rusby fans.  This beautifully-produced concert video is a pure winner, showcasing Rusby and her band at their best, before an adoring, appreciative English audience.  Several things are worth pointing out: first, what a delight to see how friendly and down-to-earth she is, and what a fine performer.  Authoritative, yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way, she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art... And, of course, the music is simply stunning -- the band plays sweet, but keeps things simple; it's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions, it's just simply lovely, lovely acoustic music.  Finally, there's the experience of seeing Rusby sing: is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that everyday-looking lass before you?  Guess so.  Now I'll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me... I know it'll be a night to remember	1
I'm a big Survivor fan; and as such, I love any of the DVD complete season packets of Survivor.  It's great because if you happened to miss one of the episodes for whatever reason, you get to see the challenges and how and why the person got voted off the island.  I did not however give this 5 stars, because I also own the Survivor All-Stars DVD pack, so I know that they could have done more with the Palau pack.  In the All-Stars pack you get to see A LOT more speacial features of things occured on the island but never made it into the broadcast.  Some of these outakes give a lot of insite into camp life and the characters, which is always fun.  But other than missing those features, the Survivor Palau pack is well worth seeing	1
I have been using Callanetics off and on since the 80s. I was so excited to see that it came out in DVD format and wasn't discouraged to read that it didn't have chaptering - Callan always has recommended doing the full workout anyway. But, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this DVD now has chaptering. So, please don't let that discourage you from trying this awesome exercise program! You will see truly amazing results in a short amount of time. I have used it only 3x so far this go around and I already feel stronger and have better posture. Have fun	1
This movie is really good for the pre-teen who is struggling to make the right choices.  I thought this movie was great! Im hearing that now girls as young as 8 are having oral sex because they want to be popular/cool and I like this movie because it shows the consequences of doing the wrong thing just to be popular.  Every young girl needs to see this one	1
I have been an Adult Swim viewer since Space Ghost CTC's early days. The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40's and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence's sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It's Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody. I tried to tell a co-worker (whose 25 years old) about a Robot Chicken bit about Hogan's Heroes and he never heard of that show! I'm glad The Venture Brothers has got a strong audience, so thanks you young ignorant types for watching! I'm in baby boomer delight!	1
I love this movie.  Great sequel, great characters, great gore.  A must for all fans of the "Saw" movies.	1
the dvd set is a good one, who cares if its edited, your still getting a good first season of roseanne. and you get commentary and behind the scenes stuff as well.if your not a fan dont buy it. and if you are a fan and you are tired of waiting for it to come on television, than definitely buy it	1
Known to all,  this is the story of Dorothy Gale and her  journey to the magical land of Oz. She meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage.  The most popular film of all time , seen by over a billion people. It's timelessness is proof enough of its value . Certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years, but still most beloved. In 1998 rereleased on the big screen: magic. And admittedly the most important film of my life: As a child I was obsessed with the film and only a little less now	1
The Movie with the 20,000-mile or one-million-laugh guarantee ! Crank your Engines ! With a roar , sputter and pop , drivers wheel westward in wacky turn-of-the century autos for a New York-to-Paris race . Ahead 20.000 miles , a barroom brawl , a sinking iceberg 2.357 pies in the face and incalculable laughts . Blake Edwards (1922- ) turns a marvelous cast loose on a round-the-world higway booby-trapped by some of the funniest screen gags ever . Jack Lemmon (1925-2001) and Peter Falk (1927- ) are nasty Professor Fate and his dim henchman Max . Tony Curtis (1925- ) is their good-guy nemsis , the Great Leslie and Nathalie Wood (1938-1981) is cheroot-puffing suffragatte reporter Maggie DuBois . Zestily scored by Henry Mancini (1924-1994) and ravishing in a New digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from restored elements , The Great Race is great fun ! . As i mention Super transfer and Recommended highly !	1
Lemon and Curtis are a great team - "Some Like It Hot" and "The Great Race."  In this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl (Natalie Wood) and she catches him.  The star-studded cast is enhanced by the superb acting of Peter Falk in one of his great comic roles, the hapless Maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually out-of-sorts boss, the permanently crabby Professor Fate (Lemon).  Curtis does what he does best - looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in.  This DVD is a collector and one of my all-time top ten favorites	1
Waiting was a pleasant surprise.	1
This film burns the screen with power, sensitivity, unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind. Jolie and Burress shine in Foxfire in a way that you'll never forget. Every woman has been a girl, and, even if they store their feelings deep inside, they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls. I know I do. But even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect on-screen. Every character is well-developed. I wish I could change the ending of the movie, but that ending is what keeps things real. This movie is definitely a treasure	1
Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her & Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina.	1
Probably the best place to start for Bergman initiates. Three decent films (although I think "Through A Glass" is in a different class to the other two features). Moreover, they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman's art from circa 1960 to circa '62; from the religious torment of 1961's "Winter light", through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of "Through A Glass..." to the explicit focus on familial relationships of "The Silence", (the latter reminiscent of Bergman's mid-to-late 60's output). In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding "Persona" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general.	1
Paris , The city of Light , Shines even brighter when Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993) and Fred Astaire (1899-1987) team up for the only time and bring their luminous starpower to this exquisite musical featuring songs by George (1898-1937) and Ira (1896-1983) Gerschwin .This dazzling romp -Filmed on Location in Paris where you could go back in time and see Paris year 1956 , wonderful made on Tour Eifel ,Sacre Ceur , Notre Dame , Louvre and many other known tourist places ! . In role of a bookstore clerk transformed into modeling sensations , Hepburn showcases singing and dancing . Fred Astaire as the fashion photographer who discovers her , conjures up his inimitable magic sequeces of many songs . This Movie are a must for all nostalgic movie lovers and a RECOMMENDATION !. Super High Quality transfer	1
Soldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must-see for all history buffs, WWII historians and lovers of war movies.  Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema,  it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of  a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands.  Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions.  Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation.  His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.  Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself.  Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film. Those interested in learning more about the real Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema should read "Soldaat van Oranje Omnibus" which includes "De Verre Tamboer (The Distant Drummer)" and "Op Jacht naar het Leven (In pursuit of Life)" all by Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema	1
Yet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can't even tell you.  Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do.  Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role.  Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.  So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end, "april fools day", vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.)  See this as soon as possible.  It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions	1
This is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties. Neither studio was noted for horror pictures, but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts. Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection:	1
In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short's humor with the exception of, "Clifford". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short's work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, "Clifford"	1
I was so disappointed they cancelled this series. I was hoping that the SciFi channel would pick it up. Hope you science finction lovers got this one because it's GREAT	1
It is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying friend.How men will fight to the end for a dream of one man.The characters drew strength from one another.It tells about the hardships of the old west.The unfortunate greed of men and how greed can kill.Tom Selleck's character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his friends.The other characters complimented each other.The movie was well worth the price.You will want more of the same	1
Regarding the above title, there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the Dvd. There seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the USA and the UK as they do very little to the film's context. Still, it's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore (if that's what you're into) and I'd still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10	1
TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it	1
My 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this DVD.  This Backyardigans DVD is their favorite so far (they have the 2 others Snow Fort and It's Great to be a Ghost also).  The music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid's videos. It introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you don't mind your children copying. The Backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch.	1
Love it...love them all.  Disagree about the pace of this one.  Heart of the Jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the Tea Party show.	1
I cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980's by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in "Big Business",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood's Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in "Big Business", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York's business world.	1
While Elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video, that is not the only good thing about this one.  It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters.  My favorite part of the video (and my daughter's) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert.  Ernie decides he is going to be a doctor, and needs Bert's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do.  Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn't know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not!  The cartoons are funny, and there is a never before seen Elmo's World at the end all about doctors, too.  Very cute	1
SMACK volume 1 represents the streets, music, arts, culture and knowledge of the hip-hop generation. SMACK takes a deeper look into the lives of celebrities in their natural settings through on the spot interviews, from backstage to the studios. Features recording artists 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes, and Eminem dissing Ja Rule in a never before seen interview. Then spend a week in Miami with Cam'ron and the Diplomats, and Pharrell beat boxing with Fam-Lay.Hang with P. Diddy as he hypes a harlem street corner battle and much more	1
Shipment was very fast and dvd is just as discribed. I even got a car with it!!!	1
Sometimes, when you're in an overly silly mood, only one thing will do: Pauly Shore. That's why I love Bio-Dome. It's just silly all over. The concept is utterly ridiculous...2 stoner community college kids mistake an enclosed environment, the bio-dome, for a mall and get trapped inside for a year. If you enjoy Pauly Shore in all his silly glory, you'll have a lot of fun with Bio-Dome. Don't take it too seriously...just watch and laugh. For those who enjoyed Encino Man and Son-in-Law, Bio-Dome will do the trick. An amusing way to spend an hour and a half.	1
Masterful pretty much says it all. I agree with the reveiwers who rated it "one of the best all time movies"---not just among westerns. This film is Wayne's HIGH NOON. The hard edges play well with today's viewers and the things we confront. You will travel with the Duke as he is consumed by hate. He's not out to save the young lady, but to destroy her. What will happen when he is face to face with her? Watch and enjoy a great film!  If you are looking for a new western I highly recomemend "Broken Trail!	1
Many shows have their moments, but this is the first show I've ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode.  The humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed.  I will say that you do need to be around my age (I'm 40) to get alot of the inside jokes, but if you do their hilarious.  And if you don't there's still plenty to make you laugh.  I would HIGHLY recommend all three Volumes that are out now	1
(Just as a note, that's the Japanese title)	1
I did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised! The dvd was a must own as soon as it came out	1
Wrath Of The Dragon.	1
I really liked this DVD...has a lot of information and covered a lot of their important games. The special features are interesting, as well	1
I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The sex scenes were some of the best I've seen because they were graphic yet very realistic. The story was touching and honest. If you're an adult who enjoys a realistic story that is very hot, you will definitely enjoy this gem. Watch and enjoy	1
I am a huge Chef! fan. I have been watching the show since it was on BBC America and my local PBS station. I was excited to find that the "Complete Collection" was finally available on DVD. I got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in. I realized that shows were missing from the "Complete Collection" like: Divorice?, Gareth's Father and the Christmas Special "A Bird in the hand". Can someone please tell me how this can be the "Complete Collection" with those episodes ommitted from the DVD?	1
I thought this was an excellent, excellent film. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed. (It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars. WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought, but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings. As seen in this film and "All Quiet on the Western Front", (and the poetry of e.e. cummings) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches. They fought for the ideals of their respective countries, but separated from the propaganda, your enemy could be your neighbor. In WWII, there was an obvious evil (genocide) to fight against that needed to be defeated, but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace.	1
You know, Shrek 2 is the embarassment of American culture. What's wrong with it you ask? Let's see... too much slapstick humor, too many movie references, or parodies, and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying CLASSIC DISNEY CHARACTERS!!! That's just unbelievable, Dreamworks! Disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry, and you just make fun of them. That's a real shame. You should be thanking Disney for all what animation offers nowadays. Disney classics have heart, humor, and a beautiful story. Shrek 2 lacks that. Shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility, never to be seen again!!	0
When the lead character acts like she's sleepwalking through the entire film, that's distracting! When just about anyone from my high school's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth, then it's time to open up the wallet, and hire better talent.	0
This DVD was horrible. I didn't know what to expect... but after the first 10 minutes I was thinking... is this it?! What's going on? Where are they? What am I watching? After awhile I clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary... nothing. They don't even tell you where they are?! It's basically a 45 minute music video. And the music, although I like it, doesn't fit with the footage at all. I really don't understand the point of this project. I watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding. Total waste of time and money. And I am a Jack Johnson fan	0
DURING A MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION, A COP [SAMUEL L. JACKSON] GETS KIDNAPPED BY A GANG OF THIEVES. MEANWHILE, AN ELABORATE BANK ROBBERY IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN. OF COURSE, SAMUEL DOES GREAT AS ALWAYS, BUT THE SCRIPT AND ESPECIALLY THE VERY SLOW PACE BRINGS IT DOWN. WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD MOVIE TURNED OUT TO BE A DISSAPOINTMENT. FAR FROM BEING THE WORST MOVIE YOU CAN RENT, BUT, IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS. MAYBE NEXT TIME, THEY WON'T TAKE ALL DAY TO GET STARTED	0
i started liking this movie, i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out, if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal "underground" cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late...if you like the depressing, gritty, wild, fastpaced style of this movie, check out the original master ROBERT CRUMB, toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of...this is crap in noncomformity, and dont say i "didnt get it", i just think hes being hugely self-indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry, lacking the wit, psychedelia, and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly.	0
This film is one of the worst I've ever seen. Amatuerish in dialogue, acting, plot direction etc etc....sure it's bubblegum for late at night but it's really breathtakingly awful	0
I found this dvd to be very slow. There is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long. Most of this time is spent talking, not streching	0
This is the kind of morbid/vulger trash that Warner Brothers does now.  With them it's a show that is full of sex, graphic content, and a life style that is really damging to one's mental and physical health.  This show and it's studio are no better then Disney and their Desperate Housewives show that treats women like call girls.  It's all represents a Hollywood that is out of control and completely gone off the edge.  I condem them both	0
This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort.	0
This has got to be the biggest stinker in Denzel's long movie career, just after the oscar winning Philadelphia, he went on to star in this cult Sci Fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game, Russel Crowe also stars in this very, and i mean very bad movie. But hey, if you're a Sci Fi fan, watch this, but don't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars. On account, this movie didn't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the Hollywood critic, The Only Movie with Two Lead Star To Not Hit The Box Office. This low budget sleepy movie isn't worth watching, if you love Sci Fi, that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race, pick up a true 5 star Hollywood material like, 'A.I', 'Terminator' 'I', 'II', 'III' or Will Smith's new movie, 'I, Robot'	0
Where to start with this bad movie?	0
I am referring to the Laser Light dvd edition of this film, which promises the best digital transfer of the film.  That is great, but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer!  I taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version I taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv!  In reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better VHS version and I would recommend that over this.  Do not be fooled like I was with the fine condition of Welles' "The Trial" by Laser Light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this.  This version of Arkardin is a total waste of money	0
I thought this video was really going to encourage my toddler to use his potty but it didn't.  This video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty.  I was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty.  this video didn't do it, so I'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning.  Todlers need visuals and actions, the bear on this video does more talking than actual actions	0
The Award winning documentary Freestyle, looks like something fresh, creative, and new from the exterior. I was psyched to purchase this DVD the minute I heard about it.	0
FYI- this is the "retail-friendly" edited version of Guys Gone Wild: Heatstroke to show less raunchy material, making it acceptable at mainstream retailers. Be sure to get "Heatstroke" instead if you want the full uncensored version of this title	0
totally disappointed..whole series is a joke...should be call Guys Act Stupid...amature editing and directing.	0
Okay, I own a Britney album or two. But the girl really let herself go... She should have stayed in school, instead of the Mickey Mouse Club. Or at least beauty school... or something, then she might have known that the hair she has now is hideous. I know I'm not the only one who thinks she's turing into Trailer Trash.. except, she's got money. That hair? Her Clothes? and lets face it guys, she was putting on weight WAY before she got pregnant.. Fashion senses aside.. She's really more IDIOTIC, that Chaotic.. she's got this princess in distress act that only her die hard fans can't see through.. I saw her in concert once, yeh I admit it. Paid for me and a friend to go. Was gonna go see the Onyx Hotel Tour too, just because.. But when I saw it on Showtime, I was SO Glad she canceled the tour and I got my money back. Her vocals were horrible, and it was so bad when MTV picked it up and they were obviously doctored.. she has absolutely no talent whatsoever.. and her vision is incredibly lacking... Her bland personality and complete naiivity and idiotic behavior makes itself evident in this show that isn't even bareable for a minute...	0
This late Keaton material - when the actor desperately needed funds - is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with Keaton rolling in his grave at this release.	0
I didn't find this DVD too bad to watch, but I wouldn't watch it again. It had tons of good artists but I dont wanna have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews. I think this DVD needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin, just my opinion	0
I love Asian movies. I like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days. 2047 however, was the first asian movie that I failed to finish becaase of the sheer BOREDOM of the plot. Don't get me wrong, the main actor (Clark Gable look-alike) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous, but the movie itself IMO is overrated. You can argue "art" all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you(not my bag at all). I kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to realize..Oh my God it's not over! BORING	0
What's all the fuss about. Ms. Hepburn doesn't act. Our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time. Eddie Albert's restraint is utterly-unbelievable. Any two-bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions! What is Peck left with? A long life of knowing he's got a girl friend he can't touch, see, or speak with.	0
This is without question the worst movie ever made. It makes "Plan 9 from Outer Space" look like "2001". Roger Ebert must be a genius. No one could "accidentally" make a movie this bad. I guess it's a comedy - that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny	0
Five Gen-X yuppies (yup, they're old enough to be that now) reunite for the funeral of one of their friends. What ensues is a parody of The Big Chill, complete with bad 80s music. Then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one, turning them into murderous zombies. So far, so eccentric, and the satire is sometimes very funny. The FX are so bargain-basement, however, and the plotting so loose, that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half-hour after a rather promising set-up. Zach Galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie.	0
This product is way outdated for todays advanced technology. It is appropriate for CRT TV's but not for LCD's. Very disappointed!!	0

'The Sword and the Sorcerer' released in '82 is a mixed bag of positive and negative.	0
Except for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser.  There were so many things wrong.  Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario.  You knew what was coming a mile away.  There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that's the best I can say.  Oh, and the nun.  She was pretty good too.  The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script.  Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed "Hollywood".  Like when the village burned down.  They were ready to just up and leave where they'd lived for generations.  As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses.  And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game.  And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee.  Please	0
lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out, ot it's me that im losing the charm for watching movies... and it more into the first one...	0
I hate to be the dissenting voice here, but The Boost is one of the most hilariously bad, cliched and over-the-top pictures I've seen in a long while.  It's so silly it unintentionally wanders into John Waters territory several times.  The thing is, James Woods acts like he's on coke before his character starts doing coke, so when he actually starts the coke binge, the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness.  Still, it has its moments, such as Sean Young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage, or Woods explaining that cocaine "just takes your natural energy and amplifies it".  A good title would be "National Lampoon's Cautionary Cocaine Tale of the 1980s"	0
This movie does a very good job of portaying an alcoholic that has not yet found the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. The AA meetings in this movie are packed with self centered selfish and restless, irrtable and discontented people who meet to share their misery. Real AA meetings offer experience, strength and hope, and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol	0
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director.to bad this one isn't a very good story.	0
Antonio Banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can't believe he ever got wealthy when he's running around giving money freely to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who lied to him from the moment they met.  She didn't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry.  Well, we never get to see the pretty girl, because Jolie must have killed her too.  The only reason this woman is "hot" is because she'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody (if you've seen Gia, you'll know what I mean).  Neither she or Banderas (who isn't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her.  My guess?  The age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie gets old fast.  It's so stupid, because nobody has interludes like that unless they're shooting a blue movie.  The only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot.	0
Can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!	0
This film itself deserves 4 stars at least. Im givin this s*** a one cause its a f*****  bootleg. I tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an x-box and it would not play. Then when I finally got it to play, it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like s***. If your into purchasing s*** like that then I guess this is for you. I advise you to cop this movie somewhere else	0
I just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal.	0
I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more	0
This is [...]. I suppose anybody who'd hire Adam Sandler and/or Tea Leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from Cro Magnon man could watch. I lasted 20 minutes. The "jokes" are older than me, and they weren't funny when they were born.	0
When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street	0
Teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross.  I can understand implying that two ex-cons have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie  with cheap double-entendre and to stoop so low as to give a lead male  character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous (OK, director we 'get  it' all men are secretly gay! You made your point, move on!) I can't even  imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this  film the least bit interesting much less stimulating. (for an intelligent  crime caper with a same-sex subplot see "Bound")  Since this  movie is supposed to take place in Wisconsin they give the locals a  Southern accent.  An absolute bore	0
People that love this series are misguided at best...it sucks. I mean completely stinks. I will be putting set on eBay.	0
This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.	0
Date Movie should be shown non-stop to all captured Al Qaeda prisoners - only mass-murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish.  Let me be perfectly clear about this: Date Movie may be the worst movie ever made; it's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of.  You may cry, you may scream, you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film, but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once.  It doesn't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks.  The only thing I got out of this movie was an awful headache.  If you ask me, everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life.  Had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to Date Movie, he would have stayed in the ocean.	0
Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that's all.	0
Don't get me wrong : I'm a fierce anti-communist. But the stupidity of this movie is just unbearable. All the american clichs about Russians and USSR are reunited here, and it should be studied at school as an example of gross caricature. The ridiculous russian language imitations, the dissenters presented as "freedom soldiers", whereas a child knows today they NEVER used violence as a mean to achieve their goals, the Jews presented as traitors (the scientist's wife looks like Ethel Rosenberg) the idea of stealing so easily such a weapon, the reaction of Secretary general (and not Premier), to send another Firefox, whereas he could just use this incident to accuse the United States of stealing... If you should see an intelligent Cold War movie, check out White Nights (it's a shame it isn't on DVD yet) or the 7th Protocol, far more intelligent than this gross, highly unprobable childish parody. The chase "Star Wars like" scene is WAY too long and looks dated today. Clint Eastwood, shame on you	0
I have seen other Pokemon movies, but this was the worst. The plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as I thought.And Mew does not fit in the story when it is about Lucario	0
Watching this movie, I am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible, and make it drag out on the screen.  The disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds.  Watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be, and how poor direction, and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness.  I won't even go into historical inaccuracies, or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early.  Makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject, the audience and history instead of respect	0
Every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point as if you're a short-attention span coach potatoe.  Ehhh, ah yes, you are.  Well, watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does.  Two or three nice ideas, the rest is very superficial and underutilized.  Probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people.  What I would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire!	0
Some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops, she's sent to gymnastics camp (she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker).  She thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid, she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time, it's all her parents fault of course because she's perfect, her dialogue consists of nothing but smart-aleck remarks that she says in that "oh so cute" way that fans of Lizzie McGuire may find clever...good grief.  This is just beyond unwatchable.  Even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old, and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds;  It just grates on your nerves until you're about ready to shove the DVD through the paper shredder.	0
i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway. worst film ever, i dont care if this did'nt help you, this film p!ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review. how is it meant to be entertainin	0
I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title! What I did see was a woman who was very flexible, quite possibly a dancer, doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements. In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.	0

When I first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty-some years ago,I honestly thought it was a joke.I mean,the young people in this 1938 B/W film almost make Ward and June Cleaver look cool.1938,is this right?The Three Stooges were still new at that time.If parents truly wish for their off-spring to avoid blowing weed,they may not want to choose to show them this DVD.It's SO hard to take seriously.Thank goodness there aren't any 'extra features' here.I don't think I could've taken it.'Reefer...' does have a sole purpose,to watch maybe every two years after dark when there isn't any thing good on TV	0
Flightplan, or "Flightpanned" is implausible posturing and shrieking. Its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness. You know where the movie is going within 20 minutes and just like a real plane flight, you spend the rest of the time waiting for it to end.	0
Most of the characters in this movie are great, the scenes, the costumes and everything but I didn't like the outcome of the story .. I felt Daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and I couldn't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl. To be honest I never liked Gwendolyn's character at all, she was selfish, self centered and annoying, yet towards the end I felt very sorry for her, after all she'd gone through for Daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them.	0
Despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie, this is really pretty sick stuff, with little or no redeeming social context.  Objectively, sick just isn't erotic, no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so.  Those who think differently really ought to either:  (a) focus a little more; (b) examine their true motives; or (c) get a life	0
How I made it through this poorly executed, poorly written sequel, I have no idea. Catherine's in trouble again and people she meets are dying. Who's the murderer, Catherine, the shrink who lusts over her, or the cop who's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key? Catherine certainly gets around: She manages to befriend the most unlikely of people, all associates or ex-wives or enemies of the shrink, and most of them end up dead. Is she trying to drive the shrink nuts, or does she plan to kill him?	0
From a big JT, Brit, and X-tina fan:  This DVD is soooo disappointing.  The DVD is comprised of whole episodes of MMC- and very little of the episodes has Britney, Justin, or Christina featured.  There is only one song where Brit and Justin sing (a duet), and only one where Christina sings.  Other than that, all they basically show are lame "hometown profiles" which last about 60 seconds each.  You get better content from a "Behind the Music" or "Driven" episode.   There's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney, Justin, or Christina.  Lame, lame, lame, and disappointing.  I think the total on-screen time of real content is about 12 minutes.  Save your money	0
They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series	0
Being a Texas Chainsaw fan I of course picked this one up.  It has 2 big stars in it, and was directed by one of the writers of the original.  I'm not sure what they were going for in this one.  Is it a horror, a sick comedy?  It is all over the place.  What is worse is that they made Leatherface a wimpy crossdresser.  The ending leaves you scratching your head.  Mathew and Renee do their best with the material	0
this is my vote for 3rd worst movie ever made.	0
QD3 has put out some good product before but thid dvd is kind of weak. The Roxanne battles, EPMD, KRS&Nelly, Canibus&LL, And Ice Cube vs Cyprus Hill was dope but the DVD feels incomplete. The Grandmaster Caz vs. The SugarHill Gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie. I would love to hear Big Ban Hank try to refute what Caz says. The Royce/D12 beef was obviously a replacement for the eminem/source beef and word is the source punked them out of using the footage.	0
In my humble opinion, the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars, e.g. the Corvair, Buscemi's Caddy and Cuervo's 1959 Buick.	0
this film had a few laughs but was pretty run of the mill. Pauley Shore pretty much did the same role over&over but this film had a alright charm to it for a few minutes. i saw it again recently after some years&It had the same vibe to me then as now	0
i don't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome. most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length. once again cheap fox won't buy the music rights. there is sections (i think) that have been either doctored or just cut out. you'll be watching an episode and you'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment. you'll think it's your eyes but it's not. thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color. even though my review isn't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t.v. so they're all still worth buying	0
i really dont understand how people find this show funny. maybe back in the day it was something hot, but now its not	0
Yul Brynner stalks about like he's in Westworld, acting super-tough, smoking every chance he gets. Steve McQueen, as always, is terrible. As for the rest of the "7", their acting is atrocious to non-existent. Only Eli Wallach walks away unscathed. Yet if these things are irritating, it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous. Yul Brynner actually says that he "might" rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically. Amazing this could have ever been construed as being "tough". It's just ridiculous, and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames. But I'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed.	0
not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable....it has none of the "living comic book" charm that I loved in the first one. that and there are only three stories and more animation. only the blob in the water one was worth watching. If you see it, watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo! funny. Romero and King seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one.	0
3 short films?!?!? thats it?? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used!  it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this. chief wooden head isnt scary at all. if you think that is scary, you are easily frightened. the raft is defiantely the best on here by far. that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit. especially the ending to it!! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this. there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says "thanks for the ride lady" over and over. i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead. that one is better.	0
Well if this movie had a story then I must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it. they don't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking (as one of the reviewer declared) about 2 people having sex.	0
Their music is great, the videos aren't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I listen to the b-boys quite a bit, but I don't find a video dvd to have much replay value	0
This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in "Darling" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her "Princess Diana" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in "Georgy Girl" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for "The Sound of Music" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of "Mary Poppins," for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.	0
If you own or have watched "The Blue Planet" series... you're going to recognize all of the footage.  Why?  Because you've already seen it.  Except this time it's going to be without the informative narrative.	0
I didn't think of it much as a movie as I did a porn frenzy. I'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know Caligula was nuts. Otherwise, then I guess so was all of the Roman Empire. I simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy. It was stupid, simple and as soon as it was done I immediately threw it out. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the sophisticated either. Or anywhere in between.	0
This is the most tedious, unfunny, overrated movie of all time.  It's interesting that this is from the same man who produced Spaceballs, which was actually rather humorous (though also quite tedious at times).  I'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it's so funny.  His utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold	0
...has a pretty thin plot. Ice/'Cave' Man is	0
On the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama.	0
First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message.  Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this.  You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends.  Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey?  No one else does, that's a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films.  He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking?  Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant " Ok I go take shower now" says Chinese waiter.  I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene.  For starters Mr. Sandler seems to  think he is a voice over man, he is not.  His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard.  One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is.  Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each.  Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here).  The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them.  He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was.  He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book.  Not here.  Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go.  The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms.  He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants "nice kitty kitty" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap "I hope you like them extra sweaty" Ho Ho Ho.  For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth.  We are treated to this twice.  God bless us, every one.  By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad  "If I move my bowls without using the spray....that's a technical foul" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God.  By reading this one might assume, as I did, that  this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not.  It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel.  The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing.  Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after.  The same cannot be said for the audience.  Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience?  There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness.  Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings.  This Christmas turkey won't even work as leftovers.  Bah Humbug	0
I bought this DVD because Amy Jo Johnsen is in it. (One of my favorite actresses.) What I expected was a decent vampire movie, with some blood and guts, and a good storyline. What I got was a movie with TALKING, TALKING and more talking, and a boring storyline. I saw hardly any action, hardly any fun, and hardly anything interesting. I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki's ex. It was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations, and useless talking.	0
Although "deleted scenes" are promised on the back cover of the box, there are no deleted scenes on the DVD. Instead there's a perfunctory "documentary" which interviews the cast and other creators, who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film. In this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that aren't in the film, but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term. Rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that "hopefully will be in the DVD deleted scenes section."	0
ALl 4 movies in this set are dubbed in English.   I was horribly disappointed. Dont make the same mistake I did. Find the dubbed ones	0
I thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot. It was terrible. First because of the camera shake, I don't know about you but I can't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking. Needless to say I didn't make it through the whole film, but from what I saw the main actor was irritating to watch	0
I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It was a DVD for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds.  The DVD was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details.  The ability to view details of color and details of wing, tail bands, etc would have offered a much better learning tool.  It also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations	0
Unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds, this DVD is otherwise a waste of money.  Spend the extra money and buy "the Life of Birds"	0
Picasso is one of the giants in the history of Art and surely THE artistic genious of the 20th Century, but this renders him boring and repetitive. It was done while he was alive, and has him "painting" little cartoon-like "works" that were done only for this DVD...one...after...the....other ad nauseum.  This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica.  It looks as if he's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work.  I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes.  Fortunately I rented it on Netflix, which I'd recommend, rather than buying it	0
Ok, I am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as " Vampire Assassin" then I run into another bad movie. Lets face it, this movie totally blows. And what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects? What was Eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie, she wasn't even the main star. More like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it.	0
This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only.  Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version.  You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place.  I've watched this movie on my 40" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version.  So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers	0
I saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull. True story	0
So disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there's no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short!  I'm a James M Cain fan, and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone's too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all.  Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate.  Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench.  Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or B&B, fit for Donna Reed & family.  The 80's Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark.  Much more faithful to Cain	0
I am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children, though I do not have any of my own.  On the whole I am unimpressed with the Barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves.	0
Mission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show.	0

Action Director John Woo's first attempt at making a good American action movie fails with Jean Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport, Sudden Death) on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars, punches venomous snakes in the head, hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground...kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, The Terminator). Hey, when isnt Henriksen a evil son of a bitatch? Yancy Butler (Drop Zone) is Van Dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and Wilfrod Brimley (TV'S Walker, Texas Ranger) plays Van Damme's southern fried canjun Uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up. All in all, it doesnt become the worst movie ever made, its only presence if the style John Woo brings to his action scenes...his lingo in the art of which he creates. Also starring Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns) as Henriksen's right hand man. Ah, gotta love the scene where Van Damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it ou	0
i guess i hold the minorty here in thinking the north and south "maxie-series" is just the worst civil war mini-series ever put on film. they took great source material and turned it into "days of our civil war lives", a soap opera of the most unwanted kind. i found myself hopeing that maybe it would get better but it got more unbelievible as it went on . just a waste of a great cast and a lot of money	0
Given the cast I had high expectations for this movie, but unfortunately it didn't deliver.  The storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families.  There are some nice perfomances, granted, and for this reason alone I gave it two stars.  But even with that grace, it's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch.	0

HORRIBLE	0
I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed...	0
This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity.  The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement.  The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad.  One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.	0
These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu.	0
A girl-buddy movie starring Shelley Long and Bette Midler as two women in love with the same guy. When they learn that he's "used" both of them, they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from New York to New Mexico. Silly and dumb, with the usual chase fare thrown in. Everything is a cliche, from the opposing personality idea (Long is an orderly goody-twoshoes, Midler a loudmouthed mess) to desert hippies to car chases, etc, etc. The movie seems to go on endlessly	0
Between the not so below average acting of Thomas and Biel, the film might have benefited more from a better script, but it did not.  There was nothing in this movie that they could have done better, it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much	0
This movie makes me want to vomit. Watching Bio-Dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people	0
This movie would have been a complete failure if Fred Astaire hadn't starred in it. I found it to be exceptionally dull. Except for "I Lost My Hat in Haiti" and "You Are", and footage from the actual wedding of a member of the British monarchy, this film is pretty terrible	0
Trash film usurps title. People that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new Mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to. This must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old German film.	0
Why oh why do they keep placing redneck Tim Allen in Christmas movies? He can't act and he is disgusting. I am ashamed at Jamie Lee Curtis for reducing herself to this garbage. I can understand Tim Allen thinking this was a good script, the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book  with pictures...but I had higher expectations from Jamie Lee Curtis. I have to say I usually love her. But she was awful in this film. She is reduced to whining and crying. She does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her.  Tim Allen was awful from day one in his redneck Middle America sitcom, and to this day retains that disgusting, overweight, burping middle America character.	0
Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things.	0

I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself.  I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't.  I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc.  I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before.  Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs.  I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods.  I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it.  I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen.  I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season.  If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money.  Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny...  I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny	0

it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the Tales From The Darkside book. the first one is Lot 249 with Christian Slater, Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi, which this one is the best with of course Slater's character. then the next one is The Cat From Hell with William Hickey and David Johanssen, this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people. the last one is A Lover's Vow with James Remar and Rae Dawn Chong, it starts off good with Remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects	0
don't buy this junk,it is nothing more than trailers for 50 movies that the makers have deamed as the "worst". like another review said just look up a list somewere!!	0

I found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn't complete a great deal of films.  His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer.  The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad.  It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly.  I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film	0
This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to "Angel heart"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo "Delta" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term "special edition" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).	0
I bought Orson Welles Citizen Kane and liked it so I decided to watch other Welles movies. I bought Mr. Arkadin because the DVD is cheap and rated high on IMDB. I should have buyed Touch of Evil instead. The quality of the picture is laughable, sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes. Judging by the picture and sound quality I would say that they used equipment from the 30's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years. Welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the European movie industry of the 50's. Sometimes the picture shake, during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we can't read everything. The editing is very poor, there are too many scene changes. When I bought this DVD I expected to receive the LaserLight version, instead I got a DVD made by Alpha Video. The case cover is different and there is no supplemental material. He was mastered cheaply on a PC with the SpruceUp DVD Maestro software, that seem to create problems, each time I try to play the disc on my computer the FBI warning message appear and then the disc eject. I didn't notice any audio syncing problems however. This movie is the perfect candidate for a remake. I give **** for the story and * for the overall quality of the movie	0
The Weight of Water (Kathryn Bigelow, 2000)	0
I bought a copy of NTR for one reason and one reason only: a single scene near the beginning, prominently featuring Rosanna Arquette. This was the same reason I bought a copy of "The Wrong Man", starring John Lithgow and - Rosanna Arquette. Discretion prevents my explaining further. Other than the scene already mentioned, I found the movie pretty worthless	0
The story is ok, but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much... but if your looking for some raunchy sex  there is a non-simulated oral sex scene in it	0

Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure	0

as I remember when i watched the original chinese version, although it wasnt any big deal but I did like it as I remember, but this version is totally destroy that feeling, something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap, especially some sound effect.

Vol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very "OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha". It seems to be riding on it's laurels, so to speak, and it's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don't like it, and I think it's been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I'd like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD's have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever.	0
I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason.	0
Jennifer Love Hewitt needs to fire her manager. I've yet to see her in a truly good role. Those terrible Know What You Did Last Summer movies, Garfield, Heartbreakers, If Only, and many others weren't exactly memorable roles. The Truth About Love doesn't help bump her in that direction either. Not that I was expecting Oscar-quality when I looked at the back of the box, seeing a picture of her in a leather corset, I wasn't going off of words to know that I was slightly interested in the movie. I've owned it for a few months now, and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and I were in the other room playing games. She kept coming out every 5 minutes, and I could tell that she wasn't that interested. After giving in and watching it with her, I now wish we had all played Resident Evil 4 instead.	0
When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark.  Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ??	0
This dvd is pretty bad. I've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the "triple feature" dvd	0
Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller.	0
The script and dialogue are lousy. All this film has to recommend it is a pretty face and occasional scenes depicting flesh. The lady is not very interesting to say the least. Nothing original. This is a cookie-cutter clone of a thousand other French movies about young women trying sex for the first time. Avoid.	0
I do not like the format of the DVD at all.  I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end.  Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout.  I don't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere	0
A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant.  From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny.  The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant.  But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.  Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated.  Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them?  The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard.	0
Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE MADtv fan and have been for years. It is easily my favorite show of all time. While I loved "The Complete Season 1" released in 2004, I think this DVD set is terrible. Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson's Oprah and Mo Collins' Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren't some of the better ones. Who picked this list?	0
I really enjoyed Season 1 but from the look of this we're never going to see other complete seasons released. Why release the best of Seasons 8, 9, & 10 when you've never released the complete seasons?  What about complete seasons 2,3,4, etc. Cabana Chat with Rodney Dangerfield? Phil Lamarr's impressions of Michael Jackson, Prince? Little Hassan Taylor's Greatest Hits? Darlene McBride? Vancome Halloween? The "Wash me" video parody of Alanis Morissette? "Lick my baby back behind" video parody of Britney Spears? The "Love muffin" video parody of Mariah Carey? The Bush Cheney rap video parody. The UBS man goes to the video rental shop, etc.? Afropuffs cereal? The early MadTV was a little savage at times but that's what made it funny. I feel it's appropriate to issue the best after you've put out the complete seasons. Of course maybe there were legal problems. Some of the humor was pretty savage! I guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own.	0

this is a movie directed and played by a guy with unsalvageable narcissus complex. always dreamed himself as a modern day casanova in n.y., just like that george kastansa character in 'seifield', a big lover, a womanizer, a baldy forever young romeo. almost all of the screenplays he wrote, the movies he directed, the characters he played were all like this. i just don't know how women would fall for him in the least sense and possibility, only if in his wet dreams. this is a very nauseating movie. all of his movies are almost the same, only the movie titles changed. the only one i liked is his recent 'match point', nothing else. and i felt lucky this guy was too old to play that role now, otherwise, he wouldn't allow anyone else to play that ambitious murderer but him.	0
I expected so much more, because it's Marshall, but regardless of where you purchase this, IT'S EDITED. It's pathetic. This is Eminem! I understand you have a daughter Mr. Mathers, but DO NOT MAKE ALL OF US WATCH AN EDITED CONCERT. This is probably the MOST ridiculous thing I've ever bought. There's not even a warning that it's censored. You just buy it, pop it in your DVD player, and listen to a concert with mostly EVERY OTHER WORD jarbled up. It's a useless DVD. There's NO POINT in buying it. First Encore, now this. I've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's. As somebody from Michigan, I saw him before he was Mr. Cartier global super star buying skin treatments at Barneys. I've never been more disappointed with an artist.	0
I went and saw another film as I was so disenchanted with this one. The opening had so little to do with the rest of the film I thought I was watching a preview to another film. I don't care for spoofs about Catholics and protestants. The Pythons can't sing or dance (for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable). I say to the fans of Python: get a life	0
Unfortunately they just do not get off the ground.  Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it.	0
Not my type of humor. I think I'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining	0
I'm sorry folks, but I went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen.  It would be a tremendous understatement to say I was disappointed.   This film is horrible in nearly every respect, but this is the film's fatal flaw: A "character study" is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature.	0
This DVD has a very bad image and sound. Altought it is a good movie, I don't recomend it if you are looking for a Charles Bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction. No menu, no subtitles, no chapter  selection. I wished I did not buy it	0
The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies.  It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn't want to even finish it.  Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker.	0
What a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven't been extremely satisfied.	0
I had to contact Amazon five times about this item.  I ordered it on 10-1 and it didn't ship for several weeks.  Then when I check my account, the description had changed to UMD for PSP.  You will not get the DVD if you order this.  I eventually cancelled mine.  Amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and doesn't seem too worried about correcting this.  DO NOT ORDER	0
I am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one.  This is not the dvd version of the film.  However, on all the links to it, it says "DVD".  When I received the item in the mail, amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return, and even told me that they would send the DVD version of the film.  Nonetheless, two days later, I received the same PSP version again.	0
I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized.  And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.	0
I can't imagine why Madonna, Janet Jackson, or Michael Jackson's VMA performances were not included in this DVD.  The most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded.  I don't understand.  It is a travesty.  I hope MTV releases more of the VMA performances with Madonna, Janet, and Michael.  I'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of VMA performances	0
I have to say, this show did not turn me on at all. I like twisted humor and a good puppet show.	0

I just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a Hollywood film (The Departed).  I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie.  After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said, "This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone/anyone with an ounce of talent!"  The acting is very affected and self-conscious... understand that's how Hong Kong mega-stars always act (its a sort of US 1930's throwback style).  I really, really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline.  I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new-found intrigue.  PS I have not yet seen The Departed, but I am assuming that it is a much better version than this.  HOWEVER... come on America, we have plenty of creative writers out there, can't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots	0
I love TNG, DS9, and I even quite like a few of the characters in Enterprise. But I HATE Voyager. Why? One simple reason - Janeway. I cant stand her. She makes me want to puke. She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They're all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality'. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'Q2' episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of 'Renaissance Man' when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ. Good riddance Voyager, and especially good riddance Janeway	0
The book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.	0
The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked.	0
If you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is "NOT" the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So	0
i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it	0
This is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy. Something liberals like to impose on others.	0
ROYAL WEDDING isn't on DVD yet. That's because the OWNER of the film, Warner Bros. hasn't released it yet.	0
Every store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video.	0
Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie.  Zero stars should be an option.  For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com)	0
I have to agree with most of the other reviews. This movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling. I have found myself watching it over and over again. I would rate the film as five-stars. Unfortunately, I can not buy the DVD because the cheapskates at Warner have only released this in butchered full-screen format. As such, I can only rate this DVD as two-stars and certainly no stars for Warner	0
Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On	0
I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter.  I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that.  It is more like a music video than a story.  The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much.  Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it.  I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that.  Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy.  I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were.	0
All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.	0
Did anyone else watch the same movie that I did?  Or should I say try to watch the same movie that I did?  I am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one.  I was mislead.  I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie.  In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past.  The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring.  The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing.  It's not funny - it is embarassing.  I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage	0
YES!	0
How sad and pathetic this concert is.I loved the Dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy.After seeing how good the Stooges reunion concert was I was hoping for more of the same ...wrong!!It becomes painfully clear from the start that Johanssen in particular is phoning it in.Low point of the show is when they make "Human Being" [one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever] a sing-a-long.Give me a break!!!!	0
This is one bad movies. I am a devout horror fan, but I was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie.  The acting is worse than bad, it's a joke.  The plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous.  Save your money.   Even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive.   There is no humor, no likable characters, not even a decent quote or one liner.   by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion, you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back.   So save yourself disappointment and keep looking, this movie is the biggest bomb, I have stumnbled across in years.	0
I have to say I had no expectations going into this movie, I watched it with an open mind, ready for anything. What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how "creepy" it was, and I just didn't feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me.  Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na ve and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C'mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn't really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what's wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that's enough?!?! There aren't any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don't understand Hollywood's obsession right now with creepy children, it's an echo of the days of "the bad seed" and "the omen" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no "oomph". So see this movie If you like Sean Bean, he is the only good thing about it, other than that see it to cheer when Maria Bello hurls herself off a cliff.	0
(1) Scarlett O'Hara is the least likable "heroine" I've ever seen. She has no redeeming qualities.	0
Ignore the blurb on the VHS box, the movie is not about a couple's hot parties with hip friends, it is about a couple's awful parties with jerk friends. Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.	0
This should have been better but Angela Bassett's performance was the best, so I guess it's worth a watch	0
Others have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said.	0
I purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that I'm designing. Boy was I dissapointed!	0
Unfortunately, I was sent a standard American copy of the movie which, of course, doesn't function on a european system, despite my adress beeing in Switzerland. So I was kind of disapointed to have a)lost the money b)not been able to watch the movie. One is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible DVD player.	0
I like Pauley Shore I have seen him in other movies that I liked so I made the mistake of buying the Jury Duty video because I liked In The Army Now and Bio-Dome and assumed I would like this too, well I learned my lesson well and I learned it the hard way and wasted my money and I have learned to never assume I will like a movie because I liked the actor in another movie and from now on I will rent the movie first! Jury Duty simply was just plain awful with it's weak, boring plot and unfunny humor! In The Army Now and Bio-Dome were a lot funnier, and if you want to kick back, relax and laugh your [backside] off than watch those movies	0
HEY GENIUS. GOOD JOB RUINING THE END OF THE MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT. LIKE, SAY, MY FIVE YEAR OLD AND EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILDREN. IT'S A MIRACLE IF I CAN EVEN GET THEM TO SIT STILL FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND NOW THAT THEY KNOW THE ENDING TO THIS FILM, THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE EVER GOING TO AGREE TO GO TO BED TONIGHT. THANKS A BUNCH. EVER HEARD OF THE INTERNET BEFORE? YOU MUST BE A FIRST TIME USER.	0
Here we go again. Another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots. The differences between season 3 and this drivel are STAGGERING.	0
First off, let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place, sight unseen.  One, I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950's as I could on DVD, to add to my personal library.  Two, it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar (how bad could it be, right?).  And third, it was on sale at my local wholesaler.  So I figured, what the hey, I'll take a chance.	0
This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way.	0
When shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it	0
This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a  chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the  director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so  terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that  such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only  hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes	0
The book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.	0
I did watch that and I did not liked cause I know good detailed information about this history. This DVD is making polishing Boeing  company instead Lockheed won this techonology war ! It is 2 hours long and Boeing appears most of the times. There is no good explanation how Lockheed is performed that outstanding job. It all talkes about Boeing and at the final it again declares Boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs. I think the director was from Boeing Compan	0
I don't know what to say about this...it was interesting but not wowing by any standards. It was semi-enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too. But the music SUCKS and thats half the DVD right there. Recommend renting or borrowing from a friend. I wouldn't buy this DVD again	0
Ok,  I'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn.  This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon.  It really doesn't take a genius to figure out this plot.  I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film's plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!	0
I am a big fan of martial arts films  --  having lived in Taiwan.  However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion.  The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times.  I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one.  It was down-right goofy at times.  I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not.	0
While it may be true that the "camera doesn't lie," when you take 600+ hours of footage and edit them down to 6, you have a lot of leaway to manipulate.  Immediately after finishing the film, I would have given this movie 4 stars.  It's very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes.  After we finished watching it, however, we wanted to know more, so we started gathering information from other sources.  Very quickly, we discovered that we had been conned.  Jean-Xavier de Lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story, and he crafted the footage to tell that story.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be the real story.  We felt so betrayed.  We'd spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown (much less explained) and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation.  If you want to see a well-made film that will keep you amazed and guessing, definitely see this film.  If you want to see something that reflects reality, I would look elsewhere	0
Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "desperate", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.	0
